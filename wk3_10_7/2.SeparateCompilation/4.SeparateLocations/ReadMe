Folder: 4.SeparateLocations
Purpose: 
    This folder and the subfolders contais the two programs that are exactly the same 
	as the ones in the previous folder (3.SeparaeWithReuse). The point is to show that
	the two programs can be in different locations (folders) and still linked to the same f.o
	file to reuse the same function without redundant compilation.

Subfolders:
	Prog1:
		source code for prog1 (prog1.cpp)
		Makefile to compile and link prog1 (Makefile)

	Prog2:
		source code for prog2 (prog2.cpp)
		Makefile to compile and link prog2 (Makefile)

	Lib:
		source code for f.cpp and f.h (f.cpp, f.h)
		Makefile to compile f.cpp to produce f.a (Makefile)

Exercise:
    Modify func() to use the argument received as the radius and compute the 
    area of a circle
