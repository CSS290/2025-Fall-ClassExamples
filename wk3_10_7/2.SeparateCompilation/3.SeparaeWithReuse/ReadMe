Folder: 3.SeparateWithReuse
Purpose: 
    To demonstrate that different programs can be linked to the same .o file
    to reuse the same function without redundant compilation.
	There are two program source code files defined in this folder: prog1.cpp and prog2.cpp.
	Both of the programs call func() function defined in f.cpp.
	Note that, there is only one f.cpp file, which is compiled only once to produce f.o file.
	Both prog1 and prog2 programs are linked to the same f.o file to produce two different executable files.
	This way, we can reuse the same f.o file without recompiling f.cpp twice.
	More importantly, if the func() function is changed, we only need to recompile f.cpp once.

	prog1:
		Calls func(4) and prints the result.
		
	prog2:
		Receives a float from the command line, calls func() with that number, and prints the result.
