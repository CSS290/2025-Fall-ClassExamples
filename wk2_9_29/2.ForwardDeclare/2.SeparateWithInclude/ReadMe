Folder: 2.SeparateWithInclude 
Purpose: 
Example is modified so that the func() function prototype is defined in a separate
header file that is included in the .cpp files that need them.
This is a common practice in C++ programming to improve code organization and reusability.
Files:
	1. main.cpp
	2. f.cpp
	3. f.h		    // this is the new include header file
    4. Makefile     // this is new, to show how to seek help from make
